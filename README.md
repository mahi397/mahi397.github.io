# Software Developer

## A little about me...
- I graduated from NSIT with a Bachelors in Information Technology, and have since been working in the software engineering domain. I'm currently a grad student at New York University.
- I interned at **Amazon Prime Video** in NYC during the summer of 2025. I worked on a feature called AI Topics which is aimed at enhancing content discovery on Prime Video. I used Kotlin, TypeScript and the AWS CDK which turned out to be a huge learning curve. It was a challenging and fun summer, and my team was the best everrr.
- Previously I've worked on Software Globalization at **Adobe** in India. Frontend development excites me, and my current area of research is Natural Language Processing in Indic languages.
- Outside of work hours, I like to read novels, watch movies, look at flowers and clouds.

## Education
- M.S., Computer Engineering | Tandon School of Engineering, New York University _(Expected May 2026)_
- B.E., Information Technology | Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi _(2020)_

## Technical Skills
I am passionate about building and designing products. Working on software localization, I play the language game for content so that customers get to communicate with products in their own languages.<br>
I've worked with **TypeScript, React, and Python** across numerous software localization projects.
